# Hochzeit Website

# Highlights

1. Slick and fully **responsive** design.
2. **RSVP feature** which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. **Receive email alerts** when someone RSVPs.
4. **Add to Calendar** feature which supports four different calendars.
5. **Book Uber** button lets guests book a cab to the venue with just a single tap.
6. A nice **Youtube video** showing your venue.
7. **Google Map** showing your venue's location.
8. Start and run the website **completely free**. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can use
